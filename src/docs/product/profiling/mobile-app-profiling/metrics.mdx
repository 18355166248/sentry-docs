description: "Measurements taken by the Sentry profiler that help us contextualize the work your mobile app does and detect possible issues impacting performance."
---

The Sentry profiler records several system measurements to help analyze the backtraces it gathers. Some like CPU and heap usage are taken on a regular sampling interval, albeit with a lower frequency than backtrace sampling. Others, like GPU information, are taken as events occur.

## CPU Usage

Every 100 ms, the amount of CPU used by the app process, as a scaled percentage of total CPU capacity (which varies depending on the number of cores) is measured. The value is calculated using `THREAD_BASIC_INFO`, which returns a CPU usage value per thread, and summing the values for all threads.

## Heap Usage

Every 100 ms, the amount of heap memory used by the application is recorded using `TASK_VM_INFO`.

## GPU Information

Previously, Sentry counted the number of [slow and frozen UI frame renders](/product/performance/mobile-vitals/#slow-and-frozen-frames) for Mobile Vitals. This implementation has been expanded to record the timestamp for every such frame, so we can overlay this information over profiling flame charts:

The profiler records the current frame rate when it starts, as well as any time it changes, like when a user puts their device into low-power mode.
