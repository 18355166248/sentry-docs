We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create two files in the root directory of your project, `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx` (if they don't exist yet)
- add the default Sentry.init() for the client and serverside SDK, in these files respectively
- create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)

If you use [Remix future flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/api-development-strategy#current-future-flags), the wizard will instrument your application accordingly to support Remix v2 features. 

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

To learn how to connect your app to Sentry and deploy it on Vercel, see the [Vercel integration](/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/).

<Note>

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
