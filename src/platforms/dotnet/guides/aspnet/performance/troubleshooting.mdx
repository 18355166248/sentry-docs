## Transactions get grouped together as `GET /*/*.`

The SDK creates the transaction name as follows

```csharp
var method = httpContext.Request.HttpMethod;
var path = httpContext.Request.Path;

var transactionName = $"{method} {path}";

// Since the name is derived from the path and potentially contains identifiers it is marked as such
transactionContext.NameSource = TransactionNameSource.Url;
```

Since the `URL` might contain potential identifiers these transactions have their name stripped.
It is possible to work around this and still rely on automatic performance instrumentation you can access the transaction and set the `Name` and `NameSource` yourself.

```csharp
if (SentrySdk.GetSpan()?.GetTransaction() is TransactionTracer transactionTracer)
{
    transactionTracer.NameSource = TransactionNameSource.Custom;
    transactionTracer.Name = "my_transaction_name";
}

```
